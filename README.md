# Running Sum of 1D Array (Flutter & FlutterFlow)

A cross-platform application built to visualize the **Prefix Sum** algorithm. Originally designed as a LeetCode problem solver, this project utilizes Flutter and FlutterFlow to provide a clean, interactive UI for calculating and displaying the cumulative running sum of a one-dimensional array.

## ## Logic & Algorithm

The "Running Sum" (or Prefix Sum) is a common algorithmic pattern with $O(n)$ time complexity. It is defined as:


$$runningSum[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{i} nums[j]$$

For an input array $L = [x_0, x_1, x_2, ... , x_n]$, the output is calculated iteratively:

* $Index_0 = x_0$
* $Index_1 = x_0 + x_1$
* $Index_2 = x_0 + x_1 + x_2$

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ITJosue/FlutterFlow-Leetcode-Running-Sum-of-1D-Array.git
cd FlutterFlow-Leetcode-Running-Sum-of-1D-Array

```

**2. Fetch dependencies:**

```bash
flutter pub get

```

**3. Run the application:**

```bash
flutter run

```

*(You can select your preferred target device, such as Chrome to test the web version locally).*

Would you like me to generate a simple Dart code snippet representing the core logic of this app to include in a new "Code Example" section?
